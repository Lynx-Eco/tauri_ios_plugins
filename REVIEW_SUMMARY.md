# Tauri iOS Plugins Code Review Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Build Configuration Issues**
- **Missing `links` field**: All plugin Cargo.toml files were missing the `links` field required by Tauri's build system
- **Incorrect build method**: Several build.rs files were using `.mobile_only()` which doesn't exist, replaced with `.ios_path("ios")`

### 2. **Missing Imports**
- **WebKit import**: Several Swift plugin files were missing `import WebKit` despite using `WKWebView`
- **HashMap import**: Some Rust files were missing `use std::collections::HashMap`
- **rand dependency**: The keychain plugin was using `rand` without declaring it as a dependency

### 3. **Error Handling Issues**
- **Outdated error types**: All error.rs files were using old Tauri v1 error types (`tauri::plugin::Error`)
- **Custom error variants**: Many desktop.rs files were using non-existent error variants like:
  - `AccessDenied` → `PermissionDenied`
  - `CameraNotAvailable` → `NotAvailable`
  - `RecordingFailed` → `OperationFailed`
  - `SearchFailed` → `OperationFailed`
  - And many others

### 4. **Missing Command Implementations**
- **HealthKit plugin**: The commands.rs file was missing implementations for several commands declared in build.rs:
  - `query_category_samples`
  - `query_workout_samples`
  - `write_category_sample`
  - `write_workout`
  - `get_biological_sex`
  - `get_date_of_birth`
  - `get_blood_type`

### 5. **Type Definition Issues**
- **WriteType enum**: Was defined in both desktop.rs and mobile.rs for the bluetooth plugin, moved to models.rs

### 6. **Missing Desktop Implementations**
- **HealthKit desktop stub**: Was missing several method implementations that were defined in the lib.rs trait

## Current Status

✅ All plugins now compile successfully
✅ Workspace structure is correct
✅ All imports are properly declared
✅ Error handling is consistent across all plugins
✅ Command handlers match their build.rs declarations

## Recommendations

1. **Add tests**: Consider adding unit tests for each plugin
2. **Documentation**: Add documentation comments to public APIs
3. **Example app**: Update the example app to use some of the plugins
4. **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration to catch these issues early
5. **Swift linting**: Consider adding SwiftLint to maintain Swift code quality
