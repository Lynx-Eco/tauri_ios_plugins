- **Quality Settings**: Basic quality presets (low/medium/high/original)
- **Basic Editing**: Allow cropping/editing through UIImagePickerController

### 3. Permissions
- Camera permission checking and requesting
- Photo library permission management
- Microphone permission for video recording

### 4. Media Processing
- Image resizing and compression
- JPEG conversion with quality control
- Basic metadata extraction
- Save to photo library option

### 5. Device Information
- Camera enumeration (wide, telephoto, ultra-wide)
- Basic camera capabilities (flash, torch, zoom range)

### 5. Depth and 3D Features
**Current Gap**: No depth data access
- **Depth Data**: Access to depth maps
- **Portrait Segmentation**: Person segmentation masks
- **ARKit Integration**: 3D scene understanding
- **LiDAR Data**: Depth sensing (iPhone 12 Pro+)

### 6. Advanced Processing
**Current Gap**: Basic image processing only
- **Core Image Filters**: Real-time filter pipeline
- **Metal Performance Shaders**: GPU-accelerated processing
- **Vision Framework**: Face/object detection during capture
- **Custom Image Pipeline**: RAW processing control

### 7. PHPhotoLibrary Advanced Features
**Current Gap**: Basic picker only
- **Smart Albums**: Access to system-curated albums
- **Asset Collections**: Custom album management
- **Live Photo Editing**: Edit motion and key photo
- **Adjustment Data**: Non-destructive edit history

- **Guided Panorama Capture**: Step-by-step panorama creation
- **Automatic Stitching**: Seamless image combining

### 9. Camera Hardware Features
**Current Gap**: Limited hardware access
- **True Tone Flash**: Dual-LED flash control
- **Lens Selection**: Specific lens choice (wide/ultra-wide/telephoto)
- **Optical Zoom**: Hardware zoom control
- **OIS Control**: Optical image stabilization settings
- **Center Stage**: Automatic framing (iPad)

### 10. Professional Features
**Current Gap**: Consumer-level features only

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: AVCaptureSession Integration
Implement a custom camera view using AVCaptureSession to enable:
- Live preview
- Manual controls
- Real-time processing
- Advanced capture modes

### Priority 2: Enhanced Photo Capabilities
- Add RAW/ProRAW support
- Implement Live Photos
- Add Portrait mode detection and capture
- Support HEIF format

### Priority 3: Advanced Video Features
- Add resolution and frame rate selection
- Implement stabilization options
- Support HDR video capture
- Add slow-motion and time-lapse modes

### Priority 4: Depth and Computational Photography
- Access depth data for compatible devices
- Implement Portrait mode effects
- Add Night mode detection

### Priority 5: Professional Controls
- Manual focus/exposure/ISO controls
- Histogram and exposure tools
- Advanced audio configuration

## Technical Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Many features require specific iOS versions or hardware
2. **Performance**: Advanced features may require careful memory management
3. **Permissions**: Additional permissions may be needed for some features
4. **File Formats**: Support for RAW, ProRAW, HEIF, ProRes requires special handling
5. **Storage**: Advanced formats require more storage space

## Conclusion

The current implementation covers basic camera needs but misses the rich capabilities of modern iOS devices. Implementing AVCaptureSession-based capture would unlock most advanced features and provide a foundation for professional-grade camera functionality.
